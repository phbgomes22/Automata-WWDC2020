 # Becoming the Machine ü§ñ!
 
 Now, let's **swich places**!
 
 A sequence of inputs, either purple üü£ or white ‚ö™Ô∏è, will be drawn. Then, the initial state will be chosen.
 Touch the States as you move to them, until you cover all the input.
 
 
 - Note:
 We can only play this game because of a property of this FSM: it is **deterministic**. That means that if we are at a given **initial State**, if we run the **same input sequence**, we will always arrive at the same **final State**.


 
 * Experiment:
 Let's start! Choose a number of inputs that you will try to memorize!

  If you choose to memorize 3 inputs, you'll need to move through 3 States.
