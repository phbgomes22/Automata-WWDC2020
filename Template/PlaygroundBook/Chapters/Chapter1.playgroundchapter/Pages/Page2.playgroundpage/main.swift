 # Becoming the Machine ü§ñ!
 
 Now, let's **swich places** in a Memory Game!
 
 **Memorize** the sequence of inputs given. They will be either purple üü£ or white ‚ö™Ô∏è. Then, the initial state will be chosen.
 
 After that, starting at the **initial state**, touch **every State** you transition to until you go through all the input sequence.
 If you touch all in the right order, you win üèÜ!
 
 - Note:
  This game works because of the **deterministic** property of this FSM. That means that if start at a given **initial State**, if we run the **same input sequence**, we will always arrive at the same **final State**.
 
 * Experiment:
 Let's start! Choose the number of inputs that you will try to memorize!
